 <br>
 <hr>
 
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Tapestry', cursive;font-size:20px;">
<b>Affiliation/Occupation:</b> Loyal to the Queen of the Greathive, an unyielding direct bodyguard to the queen. Will also go in search of mana fruit if commanded by the queen, otherwise this carnvirorous bug is never too far from his queen .
<br>
<br>
<b>Background:</b> Eciton was born of a purpose, to guard his queen and follow the direct commands of his Queen. More fierce and savage then the majority of his kind as he grew in order to be strong. Feasting on anything that stood in his path on his way to become the queens personal bodyguard. In his mind only the strongest of the hive could directly serve the queen, and he planned to be by her side till he was no longer of use. 
His carnivorous habits have led to him taking on more of a humanoid apperance. Feasting not only on mana fruits but the remaining carcasses of the mages that he defeated in battle. 
He stands at a mere 5'6 but his muscular frame is more than enough for people to be wary of his wrath. No one truly knows the hidden potential of this evolved soldier ant, but his physical prowess is above the average man and can even contend with mages who enhance their bodies with mana. With an elongated tail that serves as practically a 3rd arm, this greathive member  prefers to fight with his fists. Although he has shown feats equal to that of a magi.
